# Go Game

This is a simple API for a small game server handling the game of Go. For the rules used as a reference when building this application,
see [The Rules of Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_go)

# Group Matches

A match is the unit of active gameplay within Go. Each match is assigned a unique GUID upon creation, and all references to the match
via this API are thereafter keyed by the match ID.

## Matches Collection [/matches]

The matches collection represents the matches currently ongoing being handled by the server at the time. It does not cover historical access to old game records.

### List All Matches [GET]

Lists all currently active matches on the server.

### Start a New Match [POST]

You can create a new match with this action. It takes information about the players and will set up a new game. The game will start at round 1, and it will be **black**'s turn to
play. Per standard Go rules, **black** plays first.

### Get Current Liberties for Match [GET /matches/{match_id}/liberties]

Liberties are positions adjacent to a player chain. You might use this resource if your game client implements a hint or cheat functionality that highlights potential positions onto which a player can place a stone.

+ Parameters

    + match_id: `5a003b78-409e-4452-b456-a6f0dcee05bd` (string) - The id of the running match.

                    "x" : 1,
                    "y" : 2
                },
            {
                "player" : "black",
                "position" : {
                    "x" : 2,
                    "y" : 3
                }
            }
        ]

### Get Current Chains for Match [GET /matches/{match_id}/chains]

A chain is a list of adjacent stones. See Go rules for a definition of adjacent. Note that a single stone can be considered a chain.
You might want to use this resource if your game client implements handy functionality that might highlight any
given player's chains to aid them in strategy. 
+ Parameters
    + match_id: `5a003b78-409e-4452-b456-a6f0dcee05bd` (string) - The id of the running match.
+ Response 200 (application/json)
        [
            {
                "player" : "white",
                "positions": [
                    { "x": 10, "y": 9 },
                    { "x": 11, "y": 9 }
                ]
            }
        ]
# Group Moves
A move consists of a single player placing a stone on the board. Players have the option of **passing** on a given turn, in which case the position field may
be missing or empty, indicating a pass. A turn consists of both players having performed a **move**.
## Moves Collection [/matches/{match_id}/moves]
This resource is available for interrogating moves within a match, or for players to perform a move.
+ Parameters
    + match_id: `5a003b78-409e-4452-b456-a6f0dcee05bd` (string) - The id of the running match.
### Get a Sequential List of All Moves Performed in a Match [GET]
If you need to get a time-ordered list of every position claimed by players in a match, you can use this resource. This might
be helpful if your game client needs to maintain a UI element that displays the list of moves taken thus far. This only
works for active matches, and is not intended for historical queries.
+ Response 200 (application/json)
        [
            {
                "player" : "black",
                "position": { "x": 4, "y", 10 }
            },
            {
                "player" : "white",
                "position" : { "x" : 3, "y" : 5 }
            }
        ]
### Make a Move [POST]
Use this resource to submit a move to the game server. If the move is an illegal move, then the server will reply with a **400** status code, indicating
a bad request. The reply will contain a message describing the reason for the failed attempt to move. 
Reasons for receiving messages about an illegal move:
* Position is already occupied
* Position is not one of the player's current liberties
* After the move would be evaluated and captures evaluated, the move would result in self-capture (suicide)
* The move would result in a violation of the **superko** rule, which prevents the game board from being put in a state in which it has previously been within this match.

A move containing a position is considered a **play** while a move without a position is considered a **pass**.

Leaving the **position** field empty indicates a pass.
